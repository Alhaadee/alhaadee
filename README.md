### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a masterâ€™s graduate in Mechanical Engineering at UCL who has always been a keen problem-solver. While studying, I enjoyed collaborating on numerous group design projects and realized the tangible impact of code through learning Matlab. This sparked my interest to pursue further self-learning with Python and subsequently Join the Bright Network Full-Stack Bootcamp.I wish to be a software engineer with an organization that holds collaboration and self-development as values.
